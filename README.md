## Desrciption
Spaceball is a game where a baseball team's ship is cruising through space looking for the field of the game they have, when they run into a problem. A belt of baseball gloves and bats in the way. The only way to destroy the equipment is to shoot baseballs at the targets. Save the ship and destroy the enemies before they blow the ship up and its passengers of MLB players!

## How to Play
1. Press 'space' to begin.
2. Use the left and right arrow key to move.
3. Use space to shoot.
4. Dodge the bombs being dropped on you.
5. Destroy all enemy ships to win!

Some of the enemies are weaker than others. You will notice that it will only take one baseball to destroy the baseball bats, but the gloves are much stronger. Made with titanium it takes three baseballs to destroy them. Upon destroying a bat you will recieve 10 points, but for the stronger gloves you will recieve 20. Once you have destroyed all of the equipment your team can go to the game they are about to be late for!
