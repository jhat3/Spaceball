## Desrciption
Spaceball is a game where a lone ship is cruising through space, when it runs into a problem. A belt of baseball gloves and bats is in its way. The only way to destroy the equipment is to shoot baseballs at the targets. Save the ship and destroy the enemies before they blow the ship up and its passengers!

## How to Play
1. Press 'space' to begin.
2. Use the left and right arrow key to move.
3. Use space to shoot.
4. Dodge the bombs being dropped on you.
5. Destroy all enemy ships to win!
